This is following the lead of the Joint European Torus (JET) Facilities that have been run in this way since the beginning of 2000 under the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA). The remote participation (RP) technical infrastructure being put in place for the joint scientific exploitation of the JET Facilities serves as a blueprint for the future shared exploitation of several other large experiments. At the same time the scope of the remote access and remote collaboration is being extended from the purely scientific exploitation to include shared engineering design work for major JET enhancements that are conducted jointly by several laboratories, and for the next-step design work (ITER) as well.','10.1109/TNS.2002.1003797','0018-9499','',2002,1,2),(2,'Remote laboratory experiments in electrical engineering education','A remote or online laboratory is a laboratory where one can access experiments and instruments or other equipment from outside over the Internet. Laboratories for undergraduate education or vocational training in basic electrical engineering are easy to control remotely. One cannot see or hear the electrical current, so there is no need for sound or video transmission. Computer-based instruments do not have any control buttons or displays on the front panel. They have virtual front panels on the host computer only and those panels can be moved to a remote computer screen. However, the manual forming of circuits and connecting of test probes cannot be transferred. These actions must be performed in another way in a remote laboratory. Remotely controllable switch matrices must be used. In the remote laboratory at BTH (Blekinge Institute of Technology) a client/server architecture is used. The student makes all the settings wanted on the client computer and then sends them to a lab server. The server makes measurements requested and returns the data obtained. The whole procedure takes only a second or two. A number of clients can access the experiments simultaneously. The laboratory is used in ordinary courses for on-campus students. They access the laboratory from a computer hall or from elsewhere outside the university. Due to the low number of bytes transferred, a 56 kbit modem is sufficient.','10.1109/ICCDCS.2002.1004082','','0-7803-7380-4',2002,2,1),(3,'ReMLab: a Java-based remote, didactic measurement laboratory','The availability of didactic experimental laboratories is of utmost importance for technical schools, mainly the engineering faculties.

Fundamental to such mitigation is the continuance of basic research at the molecular level, which may hold promise of a better understanding of the organism, Trypanosoma brucei, and consequently thereby identify potential controlling mechanisms. Equally important to ultimate mitigation will be the intensification of monitoring both disease incidence and its vector, the Bantu-named tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans) habitat, with the assistance of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Trypanosomiasis, \"\"African sleeping sickness\"\" in human populations or \"\"nagana\"\" in animal populations, is sufficiently geographically dispersed throughout Africa as to require satellite monitoring in order to identify areas with vulnerable human and/or animal populations. Such monitoring should also consider the economical and ecological impacts of trypanocides application. The current study describes basic research underway at the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute on Trypanosoma brucei, reviews existing monitoring programs utilizing remote sensing to assist in controlling the arthropod vector and makes the case for a coordinated in vitro and remote-sensing-assisted in situ bi-modal mitigation strategy. The contributions to the remote sensing literature of the Trypanosomiasis and Land-Use in Africa (TALA) Research Group, of the Programme Against African Trypanosomiasis Information System (PAATIS) and of the Africa Real Time Emergency Management Information System (ARTEMIS) are reviewed.

Students therefore need to reinforce theoretical concepts encountered in lectures by conducting physical experiments on real circuits and systems as even the most comprehensive simulators cannot fully replicate many of the practical problems related to operation of real-world equipment. This paper introduces a major 3 year EPSRC project funded under the Masters Training Programme at the Intelligent Systems Engineering Laboratory based on the Magee campus of the University of Ulster. The project in collaboration with IMEX and BT Ltd. aims to develop a system enabling postgraduate students to conduct practical experiments in embedded systems over the Internet. This system or laboratory will complement and extend the existing Masters course. Previously, students attending the course had to physically borrow experimental equipment and perform practicals off-campus. This research project seeks to rectify this situation by allowing students to undertake practical experiments remotely via the Internet.

The program also provides comprehensive \"\"hands-on\"\" laboratory experience in configuring, maintaining, troubleshooting and simulating networks. The university intends to increase its student base through online education retaining the same quality of interactions as the onsite program. In the online context, the design and the implementation of an effective remote interactive laboratory (RIL) environment is highly challenging on account of the special hardware, simulation and computing needs of the internetworking courses. This paper focuses on translating the onsite laboratory elements into the online RIL environment by allowing students at geographically remote sites to access and interact with internetworking devices located at Halifax. The RIL is devised using de-facto networking standards, free software and commercial Internet browser. Real-time interaction and information transfer with the Halifax site are achieved independent of the technology available to the remote student. The RIL design and delivery mechanism are tailored to: i) provide a constructivist pedagogical approach; ii) model a collaborative learning environment for group interaction; iii) match the characteristics of the delivery media to specific learning processes (media-synchronicity theory) including the provision of unambiguous feedback and guidance; iv) assign appropriate instructional roles; and v) determine desirable student competency outcomes; all in a remote learning context.

Application to a remote laboratory of an electro-pneumatic classification cell','\n\n               \n                  The field of remote laboratories has been developed over the years. These laboratories are valuable educational tools that allow students and faculty interact with real equipment through the Internet, as if they were physically in front of the system. When a remote laboratory is developed, many technical difficulties are found, mainly with respect to the links between the different elements such as physical system, database and clients. In this work, we analyze the challenges and propose approaches to develop remote laboratories that achieve flexibility, scalability and greater educational value. In particular, we present a remote laboratory for automatic control, which includes an electro-pneumatic classification cell. The architecture of the laboratory is based on the three-tier architecture (physical system layer, server layer and client layer). The client layer has been implemented with web standards such as HTML5, AJAX and CSS3, the clients interact with the system using a content management system and the communication interface between the physical system and the database uses a middleware based on OPC (Ole for Process Control). Engineering students have regularly used the remote laboratory and they have evaluated it through surveys.\n               \n            ','10.1016/j.compedu.2015.03.004','','',2015,1,1),(112,'Towards federated interoperable bridges for sharing educational remote laboratories','\n\n               \n                  Educational remote laboratories are software and hardware tools that allow students to remotely access real equipment located in the university as if they were in a hands-on-lab session. Different initiatives have existed during the last two decades, and indeed toolkits (e.g. iLabs, WebLab-Deusto or Labshare Sahara) have been developed to ease their development by providing common management features (e.g. authentication or scheduling). Each of these systems was developed aiming particular constraints, so it could be difficult to migrate the labs built on top of one system to other. While there is certainly some overlap among these systems, with bridges among them they become complimentary. Given that these systems support web services based federation protocols for sharing labs, it is possible to achieve this goal, and share labs among different universities through different systems. The impact of this goal is that different institutions can increase the experiential activities of their students, potentially improving their learning goals. The focus is the integration of WebLab-Deusto labs inside the iLab Shared Architecture, as well as the integration of iLab batch labs inside WebLab-Deusto, detailing limitations and advantages of both integrations and showing particular cases.\n               \n            ','10.1016/j.chb.2013.04.029','','',2014,1,1),(113,'Developing a remote laboratory for engineering education','\n\n               \n                  New information technologies provide great opportunities for education.

Typical e-learning systems do not offer the possibility to perform a remote laboratory where real experiments can be done online, accessing real hardware located at the University facilities. Allowing students to connect to hardware systems remotely provides them with additional knowledge about real devices; very often, real laboratory devices are time or space restricted. The proposed LABCENTER platform is a general frame designed for remote laboratories connection. The platform is designed to allow an authorized student to connect to hardware systems. As direct hardware systems allow only a single user to be connected, a time-slot scheduling is included in the access system. The proposed platform includes a teacher administration system where new courses can be created and, inside courses, laboratory sessions can be defined. Every course and laboratory can be easily customized by teachers, without the need to know specific web programming languages. The web system is designed to connect to hardware systems through plug-ins specifically programmed to exchange information with the hardware. Using this approach, almost any experiment (hardware system) could be connected to the server. Once designed, the teacher can include the hardware connection in the layout editor, where the teacher can arrange all available plug-ins that will later be shown to the student. Using an individual plug-in philosophy directly connected to individual hardware allows more flexibility to design different laboratory proposal to students. As an example, two laboratory proposals are described. First, an Industrial Robotics laboratory to control an ABB industrial robot is defined, the teacher defines different proposals to students based on specific robot plug-in controlling the hardware. Secondly, an FPGA laboratory system is described, in which the student can download his own developed program and test if it works properly.','10.3182/20110828-6-IT-1002.00695','','',2011,1,1),(121,'Remote Laboratory with an Electro-pneumatic Classification Cell',' Remote laboratories are excellent educational tools that allow students and professors interact with real equipment used in automation projects.

For this purpose, four groups of constant-stress accelerated degradation tests (ADTs) were carried out by increasing the temperature of a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) cathodic filament, and the equivalent average luminance degradation model (EALDM) was proposed to predict VFD life. In this model, firstly, a two-parameter Weibull function was used to fit average test data at each accelerated stress, and the corresponding formula of luminance degradation was obtained. Secondly, a power function was determined to fit multi-groups of data points formed by an accelerated stress and time at different given luminance, and then the work time under normal stress was extrapolated. Finally, by reusing the Weibull function to fit the data points, including the work time and given luminance, the life prediction of products was achieved. The results indicate that the test design of constant-stress ADTs is correct and feasible; the Weibull function well reveals the VFD luminance decaying law at both accelerated and normal stresses, and the power function objectively reflects the relationship between work time and stress. It is found by comparing the predicted life with the reference value that EALDM has high precision, which paves the way for following research in life prediction methodology and acts as a guide for professional technicians.

Color analysis of soil has already been found to be a nonintrusive, economical, and feasible approach for the measurement of surface water content. However, color contrast within the soil domain was rarely considered in color analysis approaches demonstrated by previous researchers. This color contrast occurs because of the spatial heterogeneity of light intensity in the soil domain. This study aims to demonstrate and validate a new color analysis technique for overcoming the shortcomings of previous approaches. Six series of tests were conducted to analyze the color of red soil at various surface water contents. In addition, six measured dry densities on the compaction curve were selected for validation of the proposed color analysis technique. Soil has been compacted by hand to the desired state of compaction in a small mold. Images of soil samples were captured using a commercially available camera model (NIKON COOLPIX L29, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The brightness variation of soil samples was quantified using the change in mean gray value of the images. A white paper was placed below the mold to consider color contrast within the soil samples. Mean gray values of all test samples were obtained using a public domain image processing program called ImageJ. Color contrast within the soil samples was equalized with respect to reference locations considered on the white paper. Mean gray value was found to decrease with the increase in surface water content. Decrement in mean gray value was found to be more significant (i.e., 14-27 \\%) in saturation and desaturation zones of soil water characteristic curves (SWCCs) as compared to that in the residual zone (i.e., 3-9 \\%) with a 3-4 \\% increase in surface water content. A correlation between mean gray value and surface water content was established for the red soil.

In practice, it is assumed that the bulk material is approximately homogeneous while the behavior can be described using empirical models developed based on series of experimental tests. Over time, most of these experimental methods have been standardized, with most yielding a single-value parameter to define the overall response characteristic of the materials. However, the majority of these methods are not well suited to characterize local features, which often govern the failure characteristics of such brittle material. Recent advances in noncontact full-field measurement technologies, such as digital image correlation (DIC), have provided the opportunity to revisit this complex behavior and comprehensively characterize the behavior of concrete at specimen scale level. In this manuscript, 3D-DIC is used to evaluate the behavior of two conventional concrete mixes tested according to a series of ASTM standard tests. The experimental study consisted of a series of concrete tests including compression, modulus of elasticity, split tensile, and flexural tests. Results from this investigation demonstrated the suitability of the DIC technique for characterizing the full-field behavior of concrete subjected to various states of stresses and providing a mechanism to understand the linkage between local behavioral features and corresponding failure characteristics. Comparisons of experimental results to those obtained from theoretical predictions also highlighted the shortcomings associated with these existing theoretical approaches in describing the brittle nature of concrete. Results from this investigation provided a foundation for improving the current knowledge base regarding the behavioral features of conventional concrete materials and provides a framework for efficiently describing the behavior of the next generations of innovative high-performance cementitious composites.

By employing the cloud storage service, the resource-constraint data owners can outsource their data to the remote cloud server to reduce the heavy storage burden. Due to the attractive advantages, there are an increasing number of data owners prefer to embrace the cloud storage service. However, the data owners will lose the direct control over their outsourced data, and they can not directly execute operations over their outsourced data, such as data deletion operation. That will make outsourced data deletion become a crucial security problem: the selfish cloud server may not honestly perform the data deletion operation for economic interests, and then returns error results to mislead the data owners. Although a series of solutions have been proposed to solve this problem, most of them can be described as “one-bit-return” protocol: the storage server removes the data and then returns a one-bit deletion reply, and the data owners have to trust the deletion reply because they can not verify it conveniently. In this paper, we put forward a new publicly verifiable data deletion scheme with efficient tracking for cloud storage. In our novel scheme, the remote cloud server executes the data deletion operation and returns a deletion proof. If the remote cloud server maliciously reserves the data backups, the data owner can easily detect the malicious data reservation by verifying the returned deletion proof. Besides, we utilize the primitive of Merkle Hash Tree to solve the problem of public verifiability in data deletion. Furthermore, our scheme can realize efficient data leakage source tracking when the data are leaked, which can prevent the data owner and the cloud server from exposing the data designedly to slander each other.

Firstly, the different phases in the learning process are introduced. The aim of this introduction is to show to the readers the importance of the learning by doing paradigm, which is not implemented in many Internet-based educational environments. Then, they identify the most important trends in this field which can be classified into two main groups. The first one consists of accessing the real equipment through an Internet interface. The second is based on simulation, very often, Java-based simulation. Both approaches are discussed, including brief descriptions of currently available systems that implement them. Finally, these approaches are compared from different points of view.

In this article, the authors define this new field. First, they review the \"\"Grid problem,\"\" which is defined as flexible, secure, coordinated resource sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and resources--what is referred to as virtual organizations. In such settings, unique authentication, authorization, resource access, resource discovery, and other challenges are encountered. It is this class of problem that is addressed by Grid technologies. Next, the authors present an extensible and open Grid architecture, in which protocols, services, application programming interfaces, and software development kits are categorized according to their roles in enabling resource sharing. The authors describe requirements that they believe any such mechanisms must satisfy and discuss the importance of defining a compact set of intergrid protocols to enable interoperability among different Grid systems. Finally, the authors discuss how Grid technologies relate to other contemporary technologies, including enterprise integration, application service provider, storage service provider, and peer-to-peer computing.

Traditional media such as the telephone, radio, television, film, and many others offer a lesser degree of presence as well. This article examines the key concept of presence. It begins by noting practical and theoretical reasons for studying this concept. Six conceptualizations of presence found in a diverse set of literatures are identified and a detailed explication of the concept that incorporates these conceptualizations is presented. Existing research and speculation about the factors that encourage or discourage a sense of presence in media users as well as the physiological and psychological effects of presence are then outlined.

To do this successfully, engineers must have a knowledge of nature that goes beyond mere theory—knowledge that is traditionally gained in educational laboratories. Over the years, however, the nature of these laboratories has changed. This paper describes the history of some of these changes and explores in some depth a few of the major factors influencing laboratories today. In particular, the paper considers the lack of coherent learning objectives for laboratories and how this lack has limited the effectiveness of laboratories and hampered meaningful research in the area.

(Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.','','','',1998,1,1),(156,'The laboratory in science education: Foundations for the twenty-first century','The laboratory has been given a central and distinctive role in science education, and science educators have suggested that rich benefits in learning accrue from using laboratory activities.

In fact, the challenge has been to demonstrate that remote programming combined with an advanced multimedia user interface for remote control is very suitable, flexible, and profitable for the design of a telelaboratory. The user interface has been designed by using techniques based on augmented reality and nonimmersive virtual reality, which enhance the way operators get/put information from/to the robotic scenario. Moreover, the user interface provides the possibility of letting the operator manipulate the remote environment by using multiple ways of interaction (i.e., from the simplification of the natural language to low-level remote programming). In fact, the paper focuses on the lowest level of interaction between the operator and the robot, which is remote programming. As explained in the paper, the system architecture permits any external program (i.e., remote experiment, speech-recognition module, etc.) to have access to almost every feature of the telelaboratory (e.g., cameras, object recognition, robot control, etc.). The system validation was performed by letting 40 Ph.D. students within the \"\"European Robotics Research Network Summer School on Internet and Online Robots for Telemanipulation\"\" workshop (Benica/spl grave/ssim, Spain, 2003) program several telemanipulation experiments with the telelaboratory.

Similar problems are found when work is of a complex and safety-critical nature (e.g., nuclear environments, explosive placement, surgery). This paper describes a method of education and training involving offline usage of virtual environments for task planning. When tasks are developed to the satisfaction of the trainee, they are exported to remote physical hardware, via the Internet, for real-world execution. Development of the system and the training experiments is discussed, along with some of the issues raised for telerobotics and solutions to the problem of detecting collisions in the virtual world. The approach has been shown to be viable and increases the education and training possibilities for key workers while maintaining a low cost of ownership.

Major corporations launch global teams, expecting that technology will make \"\"virtual collocation\"\" possible. Federal research money encourages global science through the establishment of \"\"collaboratories.\"\" We review over 10 years of field and laboratory investigations of collocated and noncollocated synchronous group collaborations. In particular, we compare collocated work with remote work as it is possible today and comment on the promise of remote work tomorrow. We focus on the sociotechnical conditions required for effective distance work and bring together the results with four key concepts: common ground, coupling of work, collaboration readiness, and collaboration technology readiness. Groups with high common ground and loosely coupled work, with readiness both for collaboration and collaboration technology, have a chance at succeeding with remote work. Deviations from each of these create strain on the relationships among teammates and require changes in the work or processes of collaboration to succeed. Often they do not succeed because distance still matters.','','','',2000,1,1),(198,'Collaborative Research Across Disciplinary and Organizational Boundaries','Scientific and engineering research increasingly involves multidisciplinary collaboration, sometimes across multiple organizations.

A way to use instructional laboratories more effectively and offer more hours in the laboratories for students without significant increased cost per student is opening them for remote access. Hands-on experiments are indispensable but remote mouse-cursor-on ones can supplement them. The VISIR (Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality) Open Laboratory Platform offers an open standard for online workbenches enabling students not only to perform physical experiments 24/7 but also to practice laboratory work.

These practices of engineering classes/courses, used VISIR individually or as a complement to traditional hands on laboratory. Concerning these different approaches of how VISIR is used, the authors draw several conclusions - findings suggest that VISIR is a useful learning instrument, having been used, so far, by more than 4400 students. It contributes to improve students\' competences and knowledge, their confidence in lab and their enthusiasm and motivation.

Our solution to this challenge was to create an avenue for institutions to share resources in very innovative and mutually beneficial ways.

In this paper, the interaction is described by the differential scattering coefficients of the surface, in terms of which one may express such parameters of the surface as the radar cross section, the absorption coefficient, the albedo, etc. By making use of the reciprocity properties of the differential scattering coefficients, Kirchhoff\'s radiation law is derived in its most general form, which takes account of both the angular dependence and the polarization properties of the emitted radiation. Thus, the emissivity of the surface can also be expressed in terms of the scattering coefficients. General formulas for apparent surface temperature are obtained and are used to calculate the apparent temperature of an asphalt roadway and a vegetation-covered surface. The predicted temperatures are found to be in reasonably good agreement with measurements of Britt, Tolbert and Straiton at 4.3 mm wavelength.','10.1109/TAP.1959.1144736','0096-1973','',1959,1,29),(241,'Improving efficiency of Internet based teleoperation using network QoS','This paper presents a QoS based efficiency improving scheme for Internet-based teleoperation. One of the widely used QoS parameters for showing network status is network delay. With the help of event-based control technique, the stability of the teleoperation systems is guaranteed under random network delay. This paper investigates how to improve the efficiency of teleoperated tasks based on the network quality by introducing a Command Negotiator and a robot controller gain adjustment scheme using the measured QoS parameters into the proposed QoS based teleoperation systems. The presented methods improve the efficiency and system responses of the teleoperation systems when the network quality is poor.

The article describes a series of web interfaces designed to remotely operate mobile robots in public places through the web. The design of these interfaces specifically addresses issues such as low bandwidth of interconnections, control brokering, and shared control as well as interaction with people in the robot\'s environment, which arise naturally in applications with web-based robot control.

The combined system builds a model of the classroom at every instant and permits interactive viewing of it.

A remote student can ask questions in class at any time, and their video may be displayed to the class at any time. In fact, it is possible to display all remote students as a video gallery to provide feedback to the instructor. This classroom removes the requirement of physically being in a class to attend. In archive mode, the system can reconstruct the class proceedings in telepresence mode to let a student visit, or revisit, the class from any viewpoint. All class activities are archived for this purpose. Postprocessing can further enhance features as required. Many other information sources can be attached to provide all information at one place.

Supervisory control is shown to offer a variety of options, from switching to local impedance control upon contact with the environment to higher-level local automation. Wave transformation techniques to ameliorate the effects of delay are also described. Space teleoperations have tended to deal with the problem of time delay by avoiding it and not attempting to teleoperate from the ground. It is suggested that the US space effort might have gotten further ahead and at a lower cost with a greater is commitment to space teleoperation from the ground through the delay. Predictive display works well for free positioning. Local impedance control is recommended for control in contact with the environment, possibly accompanied by wave transformation techniques.
